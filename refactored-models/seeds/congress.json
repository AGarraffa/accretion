The US FWS staff discussed regional coastal ecosystems, restoration investments by the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) and H2Ohio program, and the productive science-management partnership between US FWS and USGS that allows them to tackle landscape-scale challenges.  Dr. Kowalski was invited to speak with Rep. Kaptur and Secretary Haaland about the USGS-US FWS partnership, the value of coastal wetlands, and GLRI restoration efforts.  Representative Kaptur and Secretary Haaland held a small, local-press conference.  Dr. Kowalski and the GLSC have a long history of partnering with the NWRs, including extensive coastal wetland restoration research at the Ottawa NWR that resulted in implementation of new management approaches throughout western Lake Erie and other wetland-rich coastal areas of the Great Lakes.  The field visit was captured by Toledo’s WTOL11, “Sec. of Interior touts investments to Lake Erie's coastal wetlands included in infrastructure bill,” as well as by Rep. Kaptur's Twitter and the Secretary’s Twitter.",
